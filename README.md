## Overview

The Project encompasses training a CNN model in gradual steps (multi-stage, multi-label) to recognize my 5 OCs.

### Phase 1 - Eyes only

Train the model to differentiate the characters based on only the eyes.

### Phase 2 - Headshot

Train the model to differentiate the characters based on only the headshot images.

### Phase 3 - Fullbody

Train the model to differentiate the characters based on only the fullbody images.

### Phase 4 - Multi-Character / Multi-Label Images

Train the model to differentiate the characters based on images with multiple characters in them.
